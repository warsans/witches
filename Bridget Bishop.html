<p4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Months after the inheritance had been distributed, the children accused Bridget of witchcraft. The children had no basis for their accusation and the court saw through their scheme to try and receive a larger inheritance. Years later, Bridget Bishop was accused again of witchcraft by the main group of girls who began pointing out the witches. The previous accusation of witchcraft from her stepchildren was brought up in the trial. After the main accusations from thr group of young girls, many people came forward to testify against her. Her trial lasted on eday and the court issued a warrant for execution.</p4>
<br><br>
<p5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nineteen years later, the Massachusetts legislature cleared the names of the accused including Bridget Bishop.

<h><strong>Bridget Bishop</strong></h>
<br>
<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first woman to be convicted and executed during the trials was Bridget Bishop.</p>
<p2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridget Bishop, formerly Bridget Playfer, was born between 1632 and 1635 in England. She moved to Massachusetts Bay Colony with her first husband, Samuel Wasselby in 1660. After the death of her first husband, she remarried. She married Thomas Oliver in 1666 and they had one child together and also the children Oliver had in his previous marriage.</p2>
<br><br>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridget and Thomas had a very tumultuous relationship. They fought regularly and even had to be taken to court for their fighting. In court, their neighbor testified to seeing Bridget bruised on multiple occasions. Both Bridget and Thomas were forced to pay a fine for this. In 1670, Oliver died of an illness and Bridgte inherited the estate. This includes the house, ten acres of land, animals and other household goods. His children, however, received 20 shillings each.</p3>
